## Last Week's Accomplishments

I have finished working on the foundation of the Organizer. Our team choose Vue.js + Bootstrap for the frontend and Python for the web crawler. I also set up CI for our repo so that the beta release would be automatically generated on every commit.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to write the docs for imcoming data and figure out how to change and fetch data without a real backend, as well as build up a usable dragging list. 

## Anything Blocking?

- I am struggling on how to let user add courses without add a new view. I need to draw a flowchart to help me out.
- The data source is not realiable and by now there is no way to get these data unless human beings involve. SIS and Catalog are inaccruate.



## Notes


- Keep in touch with YACS on how to solve this issue
- Maybe use canvas for flexible interaction (like [opencircuits](https://rcos.io/projects/leonmontealegre/opencircuits/profile))? I have no idea how to achieve this.
