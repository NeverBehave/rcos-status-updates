## Last Week's Accomplishments

I have busy working on Data sturcture so the event section still need to refine, but have some work on it.

## This Week's Plan

Continue working on event editing, and making a backend for future events.

## Anything Blocking?

Two of my teammates choose to leave at last, and I am now alone :(

- UI bothers me for a while: the calender requires me to make custom changes over existing components.

## Notes

I think it is necessary to divide the project into two different sections: The calender generator and the editor/viewer.
